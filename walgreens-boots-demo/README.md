# Walgrens Boots Alliance Demo

## Introduction

Boots UK, trading as Boots, is a health and beauty retailer and pharmacy chain in the United Kingdom, Ireland, other territories. The company is part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance, which also owns the US-based Walgreens retailer.

Their loyalty program, the Boots Advantage Card, offers personalized offers to over 14.4 million registered customers. These are typically based on product categories or specific brands. However, they have a problem: their data science team is struggling to build specific, tuned models for every possible promotion leading to suboptimal or missed opportunities for customer recommendations.

In this demo, we'll use a simulated data set to see how Azure Machine Learning with Automated Machine Learning can help solve this challenge.

1. Create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure Portal.
1. Create a new Notebook VM from your AML workspace.
1. Open Jupyter Notebooks on your new Notebook VM by clicking the link the Azure Portal.
1. Open a terminal within Jupyer Notebooks and clone this repository.
1. Create a new Conda environment with the `conda.yml` file (i.e. `conda create -n wba-demo -f ./conda.yml`).
1. Open the `wba-demo.ipynb`, switch to the new Python kernel (i.e. `wba-demo`), and follow the enclosed instructions.
